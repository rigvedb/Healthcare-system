health monitoring and helping system where you will be going to use AI and deep learning for early diagnostics and another section of app which will be used by patient, caregivers and healthcare providers where they would be able to ask and help people suffering from theses disease

Cardiovascular disorders rank first among the most lethal illnesses. They are well recognized as a significant contributor to mortality on a worldwide scale6. Based on statistical data from the World Health Organization, it was reported that cardiac disorders were responsible for about 18 million fatalities in 2016. In India, cardiovascular illnesses, including heart disease, hypertension, and stroke, are the leading causes of mortality.

Aim01:- to develop a fully function machine learning model for heart diseaase predicition and early diagnostic 

Machine learning based model for cardiovascular predicition:-

what we are trying to do:-

Using the GA and RFEM in advanced feature selection guarantees identifying the most relevant features, reducing interference and augmenting the model’s predictive capability.

Using feature extraction methodologies extends beyond merely selecting raw attributes, converting the data into a more comprehensive and informative representation. This process enhances the input for later analysis.

USCOM techniques tackle the prevalent issue of uneven data distribution, enhancing the model’s capacity to generalize well across different classes.

Using a MLDCNN in classification exploits the ability of deep learning to capture detailed patterns present in complicated databases effectively, improving the model’s prediction performance.

The AEHOM facilitates the refinement of the model’s parameters, enhancing its performance and promoting effective convergence during training.
